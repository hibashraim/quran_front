my graduation project as part of earning my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Systems Engineering from Palestine Technical University - Kadoorie!
My project, Quran Recitation App using AI, is an application designed to correct the reading of the Qurâ€™an, clarify the type of error, and highlight it in red. It also enables the user to read the Qurâ€™an, listen to the reading in the voice of one of the famous reciters, and show an interpretation of each verse , correct recitation part works for Surat Al-Fatiha currently.
The model used in our project trained on whisper model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 94.7%.ðŸŒŸ

- Dataset: 
We created the dataset from scratch with the voices of famous readers , people we know and our voices for Surat Al-Fatiha

 Technologies Used:
 Frontend:
 - Library: React.js.
 - Language: TypeScript.
 - Details: Builds an interactive and responsive user interface for listening to and submitting Quranic recitations.

Deep Learning:
 - Language: Python.
 - Details: It is used to analyze and recognize Quranic recitations and convert them to text using libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

 Backend:
 - Framework: Flask.
 - Details: Manages server-side logic and API endpoints for error correction in Quranic recitation using Arabic text processing libraries and converting audio to text using a deep learning model.
